<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Large companies and organizations should look for more affordable and efficient ways to rapidly develop their networks, as well as better and simpler ways to administer their networks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new method of managing networks that allows for automated, programmatically efficient network setup to enhance monitoring and performance. It is used with virtualization to allow networking devices to be reconfigured into manageable software. This paper explores SDN topology created using Mininet emulator . Mininet is a popular network emulator offers a command-line interface (CLI) for building network topologies, but what we are facing is the widespread adoption of the CLI-based solution is impeded by the fact that users who lack extensive networking experience may find it intimidating. In order to overcome the usability issues with Mininet's CLI, we developed a new and unique Graphical User Interface (GUI) specifically designed for SDN topology development, which we called it “Mininet Remastered”. Mininet Remastered is offering a clear, visual depiction of network components and their connections, seeks to expedite the process of emulation and creation of SDN topologies.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>An innovative approach to network management, software-defined networking (SDN) allows for more flexible and effective network configuration and operation. Conventional networks use hardware, such as switches and routers, to manage traffic, which can be rigid and difficult to maintain. By separating the control plane from the data plane, SDN enables programmable network configurations and centralized network intelligence. This separation simplifies the management of network resources, improves scalability, and accelerates the deployment of new applications and services.</p>
<p>Central to the SDN paradigm is the use of controllers, and one of the most prominent examples is OpenDaylight. OpenDaylight, an open-source project under the Linux Foundation, provides a modular platform that supports various networking protocols and technologies, making it a versatile tool for network automation and orchestration. By enabling the dynamic adjustment of network policies and the efficient allocation of network resources, OpenDaylight significantly enhances overall network performance.</p>
<p>To effectively develop and test SDN solutions, network professionals often turn to Mininet, a network emulator that plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. Mininet creates a realistic virtual network environment, complete with hosts, switches, and links, all running real kernel and user code. This capability allows developers and researchers to experiment with network designs and configurations in a controlled, cost-effective manner before deploying them in a live environment. Together, SDN, OpenDaylight, and Mininet form a powerful combination, advancing the research, development, and deployment of next-generation networking solutions.</p>
<h3 id="figure1-sdn-architecture">Figure1-SDN Architecture</h3>
<p><img src="./Remastered Mininet_ [Developing a New User-Friendly GUI for CLI-Based Mininet Emulator}]_files/fig1 (1).jpg" alt="SDN Architecture"></p>
<p>In recent history, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) research has emerged as a significant field, offering transformative approaches to centralized and programmable network management. However, conveying SDN topologies effectively in a pictorial format within research papers brings unique obstacles, affecting clarity, comprehension, and overall impact. [<a href="file:///C:/Users/Dr%20Mohamed%20Kamal/Documents/Remastered%20Mininet/#ref-4">4</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Diversity of Structural Elements:</strong>
The architecture of SDN topology comprises several components, including controllers, switches, routers, and end-hosts, each serving distinct functions inside the network. As SDN networks become increasingly intricate, visual representation poses significant challenges, particularly when topologies feature both horizontal and vertical layers. For instance, SDN controllers function at a control layer that is distinct from data plane devices, resulting in a layered topology that can be difficult to represent in a single diagram. Additionally, it is crucial to convey the unique attributes and interactions of each device clearly to prevent misinterpretation, a task that becomes more complex when limited to a constrained visual format. Illustrating elements such as packet flow, control commands, and device interactions often requires a level of complexity that may obscure the fundamental aspects of the architecture, potentially leaving readers confused or misinformed. Striking the right balance between abstraction and the retention of essential details in one or two comprehensive diagrams is particularly challenging.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Difficulties with Tools:</strong>
While tools such as Mininet have become increasingly popular in the realm of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) research for the emulation and testing of network topologies, they exhibit certain limitations regarding the generation of publishable visual representations. Mininet is proficient in creating emulated environments; however, it lacks the capability to export diagrams in formats that are appropriate for academic dissemination. Consequently, researchers frequently depend on supplementary software tools, including Graphviz or Microsoft Visio, to produce diagrams that strike a balance between simplicity and the necessary detail to convey essential components and their interrelations. Nevertheless, these tools often do not provide built-in support for SDN-specific elements, compelling researchers to manually design or modify symbols to accurately depict controllers, switches, and other devices. Furthermore, conventional diagramming software may impose restrictions on customization options tailored to the unique geometric requirements of SDN, complicating the representation of distinctive configurations, particularly in highly adaptive network models. Such limitations can lead to visual inaccuracies, thereby undermining the overall effectiveness of the research paper.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Flow Representation:</strong>
The defining characteristic of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is its ability to modify data flows dynamically in response to varying network conditions and established policies. This flexibility presents a considerable challenge for static visual representations. In contrast to conventional networks, where routing tends to be more stable, the programmability of SDN facilitates real-time, adaptive modifications that are challenging to encapsulate in a singular, static diagram. Researchers often depend on flow diagrams, which are inherently inadequate for illustrating the dynamic nature of SDN. For instance, showcasing adaptive flows may necessitate multiple diagrams or sequential images, but incorporating such elements can add complexity and disrupt the overall coherence of the paper. The inability to visually represent real-time modifications risks misrepresenting the flexibility of SDN, potentially leading to a reduced appreciation of its fundamental benefits among readers. These dynamic features are crucial for grasping the full potential of SDN, and effectively capturing them continues to be a significant challenge in the realm of SDN visualization.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Standardized Symbols:</strong>
Traditional networking diagrams have historically benefited from a set of standardized symbols for components such as routers, switches, and servers, which fosters consistency and ease of recognition. However, SDN currently lacks a universally accepted set of symbols, particularly for newer or distinctive elements like the SDN controller, which plays a critical role in the architecture. This lack of standardization compels researchers to create their own representations, often leading to visual inconsistencies that may confuse or mislead the audience. For example, some researchers might depict an SDN controller using a generic rectangle or circle, while others may opt for a more abstract shape, resulting in variability that complicates comparisons across studies. Furthermore, these custom or modified symbols may not clearly convey their intended function or role within the SDN framework, thereby reducing the interpretability of the diagrams. The establishment of a universally recognized set of symbols for SDN would significantly improve the clarity and comprehensibility of research diagrams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mininet-emulator">Mininet Emulator</h2>
<p>Mininet is a versatile and widely-used network emulator that provides an invaluable tool for network professionals, researchers, and developers. Its primary strength lies in its ability to create a realistic virtual network environment, enabling the emulation of large-scale networks on a single machine. This capability is particularly beneficial for testing and developing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) applications, where real-world testing can be prohibitively expensive and logistically complex. [<a href="file:///C:/Users/Dr%20Mohamed%20Kamal/Documents/Remastered%20Mininet/#ref-2">2</a>]
Mininet achieves this by using lightweight virtualization to run many instances of virtual hosts, switches, and links, all using real kernel and user space code. This setup allows users to create a complex network topology with minimal resource overhead, facilitating rapid prototyping and testing. The emulated network behaves similarly to a physical network, making it an ideal platform for experimenting with new network protocols, configurations, and SDN controllers.</p>
<p>For SDN research, Mininet is often paired with SDN controllers like OpenDaylight. By integrating Mininet with OpenDaylight, professionals can simulate a complete SDN environment.[<a href="file:///C:/Users/Dr%20Mohamed%20Kamal/Documents/Remastered%20Mininet/#ref-1">1</a>] This integration allows for the testing of dynamic network policies, real-time network adjustments, and the overall impact of SDN on network performance and reliability. It provides a sandbox where complex scenarios can be safely executed and analyzed, leading to more robust and reliable SDN solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mininet supports various network applications and tools, extending its usability beyond SDN. It can emulate traditional network setups, IoT environments, and even multi-cloud networks, making it a versatile tool for a broad range of networking projects. Its support for OpenFlow, a widely adopted SDN protocol, further enhances its applicability in modern network research and development.
